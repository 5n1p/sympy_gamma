Installation
------------

./build.sh
dev_appserver.py .

Upload to the google app engine
-------------------------------

./build.sh
appcfg.py update .


How it works
------------

It's a regular django application. The google app engine (or the dev_appserver)
executes the main.py, which calls django. We currently use the google logins,
so you need to run it through the dev_appserver.
