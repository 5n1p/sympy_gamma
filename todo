* when pressing the UP arrow to go to the previous cell, put the cursor at the
  bottom row (currently it goes to the top row)
* on IE8, the resizing needs to be fixed for ENTER and BACKSPACE (e.g. to take
  the just happening change in the text into account)
* the measuring of the cursor row is off by 1 on IE, so UP arrow and TAB is
  wrong
* the blue line for adding new cells is not visible on IE8
