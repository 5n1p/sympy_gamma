* when pressing the UP arrow to go to the previous cell, put the cursor at the
  bottom row (currently it goes to the top row)
* TAB always moves the cursor to the end of the textarea (so if you are in the
  middle, the cursor should stay in the middle)
* the blue line for adding new cells is not visible on IE8
* if you do "print 'ok'", nothing will get printed out
* allow to switch off the numbering
* Implement _4 and similar things if the cells are numbered
